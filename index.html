    Now after completing my 2nd lecture I'm about to start on the topic of Hobbies.

    Now i am about to add some of my Hobbies:
    1. watching web series
    2. playing badminton

    Hobbies depends upon the time it changes according to the age and time.
    in childhood we have so many Hobbies to tell and talk about but now a days we can't even have more than one or two.
    but we have interest in sitting and enjoying the visual things.
